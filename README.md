BlockDecomposition is a package providing features to take advantage of the shape of block structured problem; in other words, problems on which Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition or Benders decomposition can be applied.

Although BlockDecomposition is a JuMP extension, 
it is not written nor maintained by the primary developers of JuMP.

[Example for Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition](https://atoptima.github.io/Coluna.jl/latest/start/)
